## A word on the changelog

You may also notice that we have a changelog at [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
You may be tempted to include changes to this in your branch, but don't worry
about this â€” we'll take care of it when we release a new version.

### Getting started

* `npm installl`
* `cp .env.example .env`, and fill in the missing details
* `serverless invoke local --function week` <- Weekly summary
* `serverless invoke local --function today` <- Today's summary
* `npm run lint` <- Check code style

### Configuration

Environment variables of note:

* `TZ` - configures the timezone. This is necessary for dates and times to be
  shown correctly. Example: `Pacific/Auckland`
* `PROJECTWORKS_USERNAME` - the basic auth username for accessing the
  ProjectWorks API. This is _not_ your personal Projectworks account username.
* `PROJECTWORKS_PASSWORD` - the basic auth password for accessing the
  ProjectWorks API. This is _also_ not your personal Projectworks account
  password.

Constants that you might want to change (`handler.js`):

* `PW_URL` - you _probably_ don't need to change this unless you have a CNAME,
  proxy, or something else that changes the projectworks host to connect to.
* `LOCALE` - hints to date-fns where in the world you are
* `APPROVED_LEAVE_STATUS` - the ID number of the leave status that means
  "approved". It's not clear how customer-specific these are, YMMV. You can view
  your own organisation's leave status names and IDs using `curl -X GET --header
  'Accept: application/json'
  'https://api.projectworksapp.com/api/v1.0/Leaves/Statuses'` with your basic
  auth creds from above.
* `WEEK_STARTS_ON` - what day your week starts, zero-indexed from Sunday. This
  can be whatever day you want, and defaults to Monday. Controls what a 'week'
  is when we're summarising leave requests.

### Deployment

`serverless deploy` will provision the necessary infrastructure to run these
scripts. AWS Lambda is assumed, but there aren't any external service
dependencies, so this would quite easily support multiple clouds.
